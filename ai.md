### **1. Understanding the Basics of AI**
   - **Definition**: AI is a branch of computer science focused on creating machines that can simulate human intelligence, including learning, reasoning, and self-correction.
   - **Types of AI**: 
     - **Narrow AI**: Designed to perform a narrow task, like recommendation engines.
     - **General AI**: Hypothetical AI that could perform any intellectual task a human can do.
   - **Core Concepts**:
     - **Machine Learning (ML)**: Training algorithms to learn from data.
     - **Deep Learning (DL)**: A type of ML using neural networks with many layers.
     - **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Helps machines understand human language.

### **2. Machine Learning Basics**
   - **Supervised Learning**: Model is trained on labeled data (e.g., spam vs. not spam).
   - **Unsupervised Learning**: Model finds patterns in unlabeled data (e.g., clustering).
   - **Reinforcement Learning**: Model learns through trial and error to achieve goals.

   - **Important Algorithms**: 
     - Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Neural Networks
   - **Tools and Libraries**: 
     - Python, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, Keras

### **3. Deep Learning and Neural Networks**
   - **Neural Networks**: Modeled after the human brain, composed of nodes (neurons).
   - **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**: Used for image and video processing.
   - **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**: Used for sequence data, like text or speech.
